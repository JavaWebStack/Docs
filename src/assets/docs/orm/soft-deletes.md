## An additional note
Even though this might seem to be a pretty useful feature it's often considered to be bad practice. Our philosophy is to keep stuff simple and easy so we implemented native soft-delete support. In our view it's a good feature as long as you keep in mind the impact it has on query speed and storage usage and don't use it excessively.
